# Riding Ruby on Rails

This Github project contains the source code for the _Riding Ruby on Rails_
course at Tuts+ Premium. Go [check it out](http://tutsplus.com/courses)!

All the code that's been done throughout the course is stored. There are
several tags, one per lesson. Do consider that not every lesson has a code
sample so there might not be some lessons tagged.

Have fun, I hope you enjoy it!
